{"input": "", "output": "To find the probability of the spinner landing on $C$, I need to subtract the probabilities of the spinner landing on $A$ and $B$ from $1$, since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is $1$. I can write this as an equation: $P(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B)$. I know that $P(A) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$ and $P(B) = \\\\frac{5}{12}$, so I can plug those values into the equation and simplify. I get: $P(C) = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{5}{12} = \\\\frac{12}{12} - \\\\frac{4}{12} - \\\\frac{5}{12} = \\\\frac{3}{12}$. I can reduce this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by $3$, and I get: $P(C) = \\\\frac{1}{4}$.
