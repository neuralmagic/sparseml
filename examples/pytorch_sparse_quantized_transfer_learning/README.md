# PyTorch Sparse-Quantized Transfer Learning with SparseML

[Pruning](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-overview/) and
[quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061) are well established methods for accelerating
neural networks.  Individually, both methods yield significant speedups for CPU inference
(a theoretical maximum of 4x for INT8 quantization) and can make CPU deployments an attractive
option for real time model inference.

Sparse-quantized models leverage both techniques and can achieve speedups upwards of 6-7x when using
the [DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) with
[compatible hardware](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/hardware.html).

Using powerful [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) recipes, it is easy to create sparse-quantized models.
Additionally, the SparseML team is actively creating pre-trained sparse-quantized models that maintain accuracy
targets and achieve high CPU speedups - and it is easy to leverage these models for speedups with your own datasets
using sparse-quantized transfer learning.

Sparse-quantized transfer learning takes place in two phases:
1. Sparse transfer learning \- fine tuning the pre-trained model with the new dataset
while maintaining the existing pre-optimized sparsity structure.  This creates a model 
that learns to predict a new task, while preserving the predetermined optimized structure
from pruning.
2. [Quantization-aware training](https://pytorch.org/blog/introduction-to-quantization-on-pytorch/#quantization-aware-training)
\- emulating the effects of INT8 quantization while training the model to overcome the loss of precision


## ResNet-50 Imagenette Example

The [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) hosts a sparse-quantized ResNet-50 model trained
on the ImageNet dataset.  It maintains 99% of the baseline accuracy and can achieve over 6.5x
speedup using the DeepSparse Engine.  There are multiple paths to explore sparse-quantized
transfer learning with this model.

### Notebook
`sparseml/examples/pytorch_sparse_quantized_transfer_learning/pytorch_sparse_quantized_transfer_learning.ipynb`
is a jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step walk-through for
 - setting up sparse-quantized transfer learning
 - integrating SparseML with any PyTorch training flow
 - ONNX export
 - benchmarking with the DeepSparse Engine 
 
Run `jupyter notebook` and navigate to this notebook file to run the example.

### Script
`sparseml/scripts/pytorch_vision.py` is a script for running tasks related to pruning and
quantization with SparseML for image classification and object detection use cases.
Using the following example command, you can run sparse-quantized transfer learning on a custom
[ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/datasets.html#imagefolder) based
classification dataset.

Note that for datasets other than Imagenette, you may need to edit
the recipe to better train for the dataset following instructions in the downloaded recipe card.
