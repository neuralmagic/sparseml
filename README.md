## Overview

SparseML is a toolkit that includes APIs, CLIs, scripts and libraries that apply state-of-the-art [sparsification](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/main/source/getstarted.html#sparsification) algorithms such as pruning and quantization to any neural network. 
General, recipe-driven approaches built around these algorithms enable the simplification of creating faster and smaller models for the ML performance community at large.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) contains integrations within the PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow V1 ecosystems, allowing for seamless model sparsification.

## Installation

This repository is tested on Python 3.6+, and Linux/Debian systems.
It is recommended to install in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep your system in order.
Currently supported ML Frameworks are the following: `torch>=1.1.0,<=1.8.0`, `tensorflow>=1.8.0,<=2.0.0`, `tensorflow.keras >= 2.2.0`.

Install with pip using:

```bash
pip install sparseml
```

More information on installation such as optional dependencies and requirements can be found [here](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/sparseml/source/installation.html).

## Quick Tour

To enable flexibility, ease of use, and repeatability, sparsifying a model is done using a recipe.
The recipes encode the instructions needed for modifying the model and/or training process as a list of modifiers.
Example modifiers can be anything from setting the learning rate for the optimizer to gradual magnitude pruning.
The files are written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and stored in YAML or [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files using [YAML front matter](https://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html).
The rest of the SparseML system is coded to parse the recipes into a native format for the desired framework and apply the modifications to the model and training pipeline.

`ScheduledModifierManager` classes can be created from recipes in all supported ML frameworks.
The manager classes handle overriding the training graphs to apply the modifiers as described in the desired recipe.
Managers can apply recipes in one shot or training aware ways. 
One shot is invoked by calling `.apply(...)` on the manager while training aware requires calls into `initialize(...)` (optional), `modify(...)`, and `finalize(...)`.

For the frameworks, this means only a few lines of code need to be added to begin supporting pruning, quantization, and other modifications to most training pipelines.
For example, the following applies a recipe in a training aware manner:
```python
model = Model()  # model definition
optimizer = Optimizer()  # optimizer definition
train_data = TrainData()  # train data definition
batch_size = BATCH_SIZE  # training batch size
steps_per_epoch = len(train_data) // batch_size

from sparseml.pytorch.optim import ScheduledModifierManager
manager = ScheduledModifierManager.from_yaml(PATH_TO_RECIPE)
optimizer = manager.modify(model, optimizer, steps_per_epoch)

# PyTorch training code

manager.finalize(model)
```

Instead of training aware, the following example code shows how to execute a recipe in a one shot manner:
```python
model = Model()  # model definition

from sparseml.pytorch.optim import ScheduledModifierManager
manager = ScheduledModifierManager.from_yaml(PATH_TO_RECIPE)
manager.apply(model)
```

    abstract = {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.}
