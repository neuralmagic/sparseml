# Scripts for SparseML

This directory provides easy-of-use scripts for performing common SparseML work
flows.  This includes
model training, pruning, quantization, exporting, and sensitivity analysis.

These scripts natively support models in the SparseML submodules, however can be adapted for use with your own models
or used to inspire new workflows.  To see examples of simple integrations with SparseML check out our
[notebooks](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/tree/main/notebooks)
and [examples](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/tree/main/examples).  

To run one of the scripts, invoke it with a Python command from the command line along with the relevant arguments.

```bash
python scripts/<SCRIPT>.py <TASK-NAME> <KW-ARGUMENTS>
```

Each script file is fully documented with descriptions, command help printouts, and example commands.  You can also
run any script with `-h` or `--help` to see the help printout.
