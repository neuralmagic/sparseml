"","I need to choose 6 people out of 14, and the order does not matter. This is a combination problem, not a permutation problem. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of choices and r is the number of selections. Plugging in the numbers, I get 14C6 = 14! / (6! * 8!) = 3003. ","My school\'s math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team without restrictions?","MATH/PRM-800K"
