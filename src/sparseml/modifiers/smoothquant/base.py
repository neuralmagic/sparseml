     Implements the SmoothQuant algorithm from https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438. This
     modifier performs a channel-wise smoothing of outliers in activations, making them
     easier to quantize by reducing the dynamic range. The smoothing is offset by
     applying the inverse operation to the next layer of weights, making the weights
     slightly more difficult to quantize.

     Because this modifier manipulates the weights of the model, it can only be used in
     in one-shot and not during training. Activation ranges are determined by running a
     small set of calibration data through the model.

    example recipe:
     ```yaml
     SmoothQuantModifier:
       smoothing_strength: 0.5
       mappings: [
         [["re:.*q_proj", "re:.*k_proj", "re:.*v_proj"], "re:.*self_attn_layer_norm"],
