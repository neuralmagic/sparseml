    """
    Gathers all nodes in the `graph` that match the `op_type` and the
    have the specified parent/children structure,
    controlled via parent_ops/children_ops.

    A simple example just matching against op_type:

        ```python
        matches = get_structural_matches(graph, op_type="Identity")
        for match in matches:
            id_node = match.node
            assert isinstance(id_node, onnx.NodeProto) and id_node.op_type == "Identity"
            assert match.parents == []
            assert match.children == []
        ```

    `parent_ops` and `children_ops` are list of list of op type strings.
    It's a list of lists because nodes can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
    So each sub list in `parent_ops` and `children_ops` will be
    matched against the corresponding entry in node.input/node.output. I.e.
        - parent_ops[0] will be compared against node.input[0]
        - parent_ops[2] will be compared against node.input[2]
        - children_ops[3] will be compared against node.output[3]
    Because of this, if the length of node.input/node.output is shorter
    than parent_ops/children_ops, it is not a possible match and will
    be discarded.

    Here's a simple example of matching against an identity node
    with a single parent (because there is a single list in parent_ops),
    and the parent must be an initializer (the INITIALIZER_MATCH value):
    ```python
    matches = get_structural_matches(
        graph,
        op_type="Identity",
        parent_ops=[[INITIALIZER_MATCH]]
    )
    for match in matches:
        id_node = match.node
        (init, ) = match.parents[0]
        assert isinstance(init, onnx.TensorProto)
    ```

    Here is a really complicated example with optional nodes and multiple parents. Here
    we match against MatMul nodes that have at least 2 inputs from Quant/Dequant
    sequences. After the MatMul node there are two optional nodes followed by
    a Quant/Dequant sequence.

    If the optional_nodes are found, then the values in children_ops will be the nodes.
    If the optional nodes are NOT found, then those entries in children_ops
    will be None.

    In both cases, the length of match.children[0] will be the same as
    the length of children_ops[0].

    ```python
    matches = get_structural_matches(
        graph,
        op_type="MatMul",
        parent_ops=[
            ["QuantizeLinear", "DequantizeLinear"],
            ["QuantizeLinear", "DequantizeLinear"],
        ],
        children_ops=[
            [
                optional_node("Transpose"),
                optional_node("Reshape"),
                "QuantizeLinear",
                "DequantizeLinear",
            ]
        ]
    )
    for match in matches:
        matmul_node = match.node
        parent_0_quant, parent_0_dequant = match.parents[0]
        parent_1_quant, parent_1_dequant = match.parents[1]
