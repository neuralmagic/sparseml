# SparseML YOLOv5 Integration
This directory combines the SparseML recipe-driven approach with the 
[ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repository.
By integrating the robust training flows in the `yolov5` repository with the SparseML code base, we enable model sparsification techniques on the popular [YOLOv5 architecture](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/280)
as well as the updated [YOLOV5x6 architecture](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/tag/v5.0),
creating smaller and faster deployable versions.
The techniques include, but are not limited to:
- Pruning
- Quantization
- Sparse Transfer Learning

After training, the model can be deployed with Neural Magic's DeepSparse Engine. The engine enables inference with GPU-class performance directly on your CPU.

This integration enables spinning up one of the following end-to-end functionalities:
- **Sparsification of YOLOv5 Models** - easily sparsify any of the YOLOV5 and YOLOV5x6 models, from YOLOv5n to YOLOv5x models. 
- **Sparse Transfer Learning** - fine-tune a sparse backbone model (or use one of our [sparse pre-trained models](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?domain=cv&sub_domain=detection&page=1)) on your own, private dataset.

## Installation

```pip install sparseml[torchvision]```

Note: YOLOV5 will not immediately install with this command. Instead, a sparsification-compatible version of YOLOv5 will install on the first invocation of the YOLOv5 code in SparseML.

## Quick Tour

### Recipes

Recipes encode the instructions and hyperparameters for sparsifying a model using modifiers to the training process.
The modifiers can range from pruning and quantization to learning rate and weight decay.
When appropriately combined, it becomes possible to create highly sparse and accurate models.

### SparseZoo

Neural Magicâ€™s ML team creates sparsified models that allow anyone to plug in their data and leverage pre-sparsified models from the SparseZoo.
Select a yolov5 model from the [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?repo=ultralytics&page=1).

### SparseML CLI

The SparseML installation provides a CLI for running YOLOv5 scripts with SparseML capability. The full set of commands is included below

```bash
sparseml.yolov5.train
sparseml.yolov5.val
sparseml.yolov5.export_onnx
sparseml.yolov5.val_onnx
```

Appending the `--help` argument displays a full list of options for the command:
```bash
sparseml.yolov5.train --help
```

## Getting Started

### Sparsifying YOLOv5
In the example below, a YOLOv5s model pre-trained on COCO is pruned and quantized with recipe 
`zoo:cv/detection/yolov5-s/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94` (located in [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/cv%2Fdetection%2Fyolov5-s%2Fpytorch%2Fultralytics%2Fcoco%2Fpruned_quant-aggressive_94)) while continuing training on COCO. You may sparsify your model while training on your own, private (downstream) dataset or while continuing training with the original (upstream) dataset.  

```bash
sparseml.yolov5.train \
  --weights zoo:cv/detection/yolov5-s/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/base-none \   # Pre-trained model weights
  --data coco.yaml \                                                         # Dataset to continue training on
  --hyp data/hyps/hyp.scratch.yaml \                                         # Training hyperparameters
  --recipe zoo:cv/detection/yolov5-s/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94 
```

### Sparse Transfer Learning

Once you sparsify a model using SparseML, you can easily sparse fine-tune it on a new dataset.
While you are free to use your backbone, we encourage you to leverage one of our [sparse pre-trained models](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com) to boost your productivity!

In the example below, we fetch a pruned, quantized BERT model, pre-trained on Wikipedia and Bookcorpus datasets. We then fine-tune the model to the SQuAD dataset. 
```bash
sparseml.yolov5.train \
  --data VOC.yaml \
  --cfg ../models_v5.0/yolov5s.yaml \
  --weights zoo:cv/detection/yolov5-s/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/ pruned_quant-aggressive_94?recipe_type=transfer \
  --hyp data/hyps/hyp.finetune.yaml \
  --recipe ../recipes/yolov5.transfer_learn_pruned_quantized.md
```

## Once the Training is Done...

### Exporting the Sparse Model to ONNX
The DeepSparse Engine accepts ONNX formats and is engineered to significantly speed up inference on CPUs for the sparsified models from this integration.

The SparseML installation provides a `sparseml.yolov5.export_onnx` command that you can use to load the training model folder and create a new `model.onnx` file within. The export process is modified such that the quantized and pruned models are corrected and folded properly. Be sure the `--weights` argument points to your trained model. 
```bash
sparseml.yolov5.export_onnx \
    --weights path/to/weights.pt \
    --dynamic 
```

### DeepSparse Engine Benchmarking and Deployment

Once the model is exported to the ONNX format, it is ready for deployment with the DeepSparse Engine. 

To benchmark the model, you can run

```bash
deepsparse.benchmark path/to/model.onnx
```

To run validation in the DeepSparse Engine, you can run

```bash
sparseml.yolov5.val_onnx path/to/model.onnx --data coco128.yaml
```


To learn more about the engine and deploying your model, refer to the [appropriate documentation in the DeepSparse repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples/ultralytics-yolo)
