# SparseML Hugging Face Integration

By integrating with robust training flows in the Transformers repository, SparseML enables you to train inference-optimized sparse versions of NLP models like BERT on your dataset.

There are two pathways:
- **Sparse Transfer Learning** - fine-tune a pre-sparsified NLP checkpoint on your own dataset **[RECOMMENDED]**
- **Sparsification from Scratch** - apply pruning and quantization to sparsify `transformer` models from scratch.

Once trained, SparseML enables you to export models to the ONNX format, such that they can be deployed with DeepSparse.

## Installation

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install sparseml[torch]
```

**Note**: Transformers will not immediately install with this command. Instead, a sparsification-compatible version of Transformers will install on the first invocation of the Transformers code in SparseML.

## Quick Tour

### SparseZoo

Neural Magic has pre-sparsified many common models, including BERT-base, BERT-large, DistillBERT, and RoBERTa. These models and associated sparsification recipes can be deployed directly or can be fine-tuned onto custom dataset via sparse transfer learning. This makes it easy to create a sparse version of model trained on your dataset.

Check out the model cards in the [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?repo=huggingface&page=1).

### Recipes

SparseML Recipes are YAML files that encode the instructions for sparsifying a model or sparse transfer learning. The SparseML CLI and Python API accept the recipes as inputs, parse the instructions, and apply the specified algorithms and hyperparameters during the training process.

### SparseML CLI

SparseML's CLI enables you to kick-off sparsification workflows with various utilities like creating training pipelines, dataset loading, checkpoint saving, metric reporting, and logging handled for you. Appending the `--help` argument will provide a full list of options for training in SparseML:

```bash
sparseml.transformers.[task] --help
```

output:
```bash
--output_dir:                  The directory in which to store the outputs from the training runs such as results, the trained model, and supporting files.
--model_name_or_path:          The path or SparseZoo stub for the model to load for training.
--recipe:                      The path or SparseZoo stub for the recipe to use to apply sparsification algorithms or sparse transfer learning to the model.
--distill_teacher:             The path or SparseZoo stub for the teacher to load for distillation.
--dataset_name or --task_name: The dataset or task to load for training.
```

Currently supported tasks include: 
- `masked_language_modeling`
- `text_classification`
- `token_classification`
- `question_answering`

### SparseML Python API

For additional flexibility, SparseML also offers a `Trainer` class that inherits from the familiar [Transformers's Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer). 

SparseML's `Trainer` inherits all of the functionality from the Transformers repository, but also accepts a `recipe`, which allows you to specify sparsity-related algorithms and hyperparameters. The `Trainer` parses the recipe and adjusts the training loop to apply sparsification algorithms or sparse transfer learning. As such, you can leverage Hugging Face's friendly utilities such as the Model Hub, `AutoTokenizers`, `AutoModels`, and `datasets` in concert with SparseML's sparsity-related algorithms!

We create the `Trainer` and kick of a run like this:

```python
from sparseml.transformers.sparsification import Trainer, TrainingArguments

def run_training(model, model_path, recipe_path, teacher, training_args, dataset, tokenizer, compute_metrics):
    # setup training loop based on recipe passed
    trainer = Trainer(
        recipe=recipe_path,
        model=model,
        model_state_path=model_path,
        distill_teacher=teacher,
        metadata_args=["per_device_train_batch_size","per_device_eval_batch_size","fp16"],
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=dataset["train"],
        eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        compute_metrics=compute_metrics
    )

    # run training
    trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=False)
```

Check out the tutorials for actual working examples using the `Trainer` class.

## Quick Start: Sparse Transfer Learning

### Overview

Sparse Transfer is quite similiar to the typical transfer learing process used to train NLP models, where we fine-tune a pretrained checkpoint onto a smaller downstream dataset. With Sparse Transfer Learning, we simply start the fine-tuning process from a pre-sparsified checkpoint and maintain sparsity while the training process occurs.

In this example, we will fine-tune a [90% pruned version of BERT](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Fmasked_language_modeling%2Fobert-base%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fwikipedia_bookcorpus%2Fpruned90-none) onto SST2.

### Dense Teacher Creation

To support the transfer learning process, we can (optionally) apply model distillation. To enable distillation, we first create a dense teacher model. If you already have a Transformers-compatible model, you can use this as the dense teacher in place of training one from scratch.

Run the following to fine-tune a dense BERT model from the SparseZoo on the SST2 dataset:
```bash
sparseml.transformers.text_classification \
  --output_dir dense_obert-text_classification_sst2 \
  --model_name_or_path zoo:nlp/masked_language_modeling/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/wikipedia_bookcorpus/base-none \
  --recipe zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/base-none \
  --task_name sst2 --max_seq_length 128 --per_device_train_batch_size 32 --per_device_eval_batch_size 32 --preprocessing_num_workers 6 \
  --do_train --do_eval --evaluation_strategy epoch --fp16 --seed 20811 \
  --save_strategy epoch --save_total_limit 1
```

The resulting model achieves 92.9% validation accuracy.

### Kick off Training

We can start the Sparse Transfer Learning by passing a starting checkpoint  and recipe to the training script. For Sparse Transfer, we will use a recipe that instructs SparseML to maintain sparsity during training and to quantize the model. For the SST2 dataset, there is a [transfer learning recipe available in SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/models/nlp%2Fsentiment_analysis%2Fobert-base%2Fpytorch%2Fhuggingface%2Fsst2%2Fpruned90_quant-none), identified by the following SparseZoo stub:
```
zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none
```

SparseML parses the `Modifers` in the recipe and updates the training loop with logic encoded therein.
   
The key `Modifiers` for sparse transfer learning are the following:
- `ConstantPruningModifier` instructs SparseML to maintain the sparsity structure of the network during the fine-tuning process
- `QuantizationModifier` instructs SparseML to apply quantization aware training to quantize the weights over the final epochs
- `DistillationModifier` instructs SparseML to apply model distillation at the logit layer

Run the following to sparse transfer learn the 90% pruned BERT model on the SST2 dataset:
```bash
sparseml.transformers.text_classification \
  --output_dir pruned_quantized_obert-text_classification_sst2 \
  --model_name_or_path zoo:nlp/masked_language_modeling/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/wikipedia_bookcorpus/pruned90-none \
  --recipe zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none \
  --distill_teacher zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/base-none \
  --task_name sst2 --max_seq_length 128 --per_device_train_batch_size 32 --per_device_eval_batch_size 32 --preprocessing_num_workers 6 \
  --do_train --do_eval --evaluation_strategy epoch --fp16  \
  --save_strategy epoch --save_total_limit 1
```

The script uses the SparseZoo stubs to identify and download the starting checkpoint and YAML-based recipe file from the SparseZoo. SparseML parses the transfer learning recipe and adjusts the trainign process to maintain sparsity during the fine-tuning process.

The resulting model is 90% pruned and quantized, and achieves 92% validation accuracy on SST2!

Keep in mind that the `--distill_teacher` argument is set to pull a dense SST2 model from the SparseZoo. If you trained a dense teacher with the command from above, update the script to use `--distill_teacher ./dense_obert-text_classification_sst2`.

### Export to ONNX

The SparseML installation provides a `sparseml.transformers.export_onnx` command that you can use to export the model to ONNX. Be sure the `--model_path` argument points to your trained model:

```bash
sparseml.transformers.export_onnx \
    --model_path ./pruned_quantized_obert-text_classification_sst2 \
    --task text_classification
```

The command creates a `./deployment` folder in your local directory, which contains the ONNX file and necessary Hugging Face tokenizer and configuration files.

### DeepSparse Deployment

Now that the model is in an ONNX format, it is ready for deployment with the DeepSparse. 

Run the following command to install it:

```bash
pip install deepsparse
```

#### DeepSparse Pipelines

The Python code below gives an example for using the DeepSparse Pipeline API with sentiment analysis. Be sure to change out the `model_path` argument for the model folder of your trained model:

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

# create pipeline, compile model
model_path = "./deployment"
sa_pipeline = Pipeline.create(task="sentiment-analysis", model_path=model_path)

# run inference with deepsparse making the predictions on the CPU!
inference = sa_pipeline("I love using DeepSparse to speed up my inferences")
print(inference)
# >> labels=['positive'] scores=[0.9972139000892639]
```

#### Other Deployment Options
