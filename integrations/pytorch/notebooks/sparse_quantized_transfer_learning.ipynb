    "# Sparse-Quantized Transfer Learning in PyTorch using SparseML\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough for creating a performant sparse-quantized model\n",
    "by transfer learning the pruned structure from an already sparse-quantized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse-quantized models combine [pruning](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-overview/) and [quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061) to reduce both the number of parameters and the precision of the remaining parameters to significantly increase the performance of neural networks. Using these optimizations, your model will obtain significantly better (around 7x vs. unoptimized) performance at inference time using the [DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse-quantized transfer learning takes two steps. [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) recipes make it easy to perform these optimizations:\n",
    "- First, fine-tune a pre-trained sparse model for the transfer dataset while maintaining the pre-trained sparsity structure.\n",
    "- Second, perform [quantization-aware training (QAT)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introduction-to-quantization-on-pytorch/#quantization-aware-training) to quantize the now sparse model while still holding the same sparsity structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Set up the model and dataset\n",
    "- Define a generic PyTorch training flow\n",
    "- Integrate the PyTorch flow with SparseML for transfer learning\n",
    "- Perform sparse transfer learning and quantization-aware training using the PyTorch and SparseML flow\n",
    "- Export to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) and convert the model from a QAT\n",
    "- Compare DeepSparse Engine benchmarks of the final sparse-quantized model to an unoptimized model\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading through this notebook will be reasonably quick to gain an intuition for how to plug SparseML into your PyTorch training flow for transfer learning and generically. Rough time estimates for fully pruning the default model are given. Note that training with the PyTorch CPU implementation will be much slower than a GPU:\n",
    "- 30 minutes on a GPU\n",
    "- 90 minutes on a laptop CPU"
