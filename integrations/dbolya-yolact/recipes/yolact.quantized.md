# YOLACT Quantized

This recipe quantizes a [YOLACT](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact) model.
Training was done using 4 GPUs with a total batch size of 64 using the 
[SparseML integration with dbolya/yolact](../).
When running, adjust hyper-parameters based on the training environment and dataset.

## Training

To set up the training environment, follow the instructions on the [integration README](../README.md).
Using the given training script from the `yolact` directory the following command can be used to launch this recipe. 
Adjust the script command for your GPU device setup. 
YOLACT supports DataParallel. Currently, this repo only supports YOLACT models with a DarkNet53 backbone.

*script command:*

```
python train.py \
--recipe=../recipes/yolact.quantized.md \
--resume=zoo:cv/segmentation/yolact-darknet53/pytorch/dbolya/coco/base-none
```
