# SparseML YOLACT Integration

This directory combines the [SparseML](../../) recipe-driven approach with the 
[dbolya/yolact](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact) repository.
By integrating the training flows in the `yolact` repository with the SparseML 
code base,
we enable model sparsification techniques on the popular 
[YOLACT architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)
creating smaller and faster deployable versions.
The techniques include, but are not limited to:

- Pruning
- Quantization
- Pruning + Quantization
- Sparse Transfer Learning

## Installation

To begin, run the following command in the root directory of this integration 
(`cd integrations/yolact`):

```bash
bash setup_integration.sh
```

## Quick Tour

### Recipes
Recipes encode the instructions and hyperparameters for sparsifying a model using modifiers to the training process.
The modifiers can range from pruning and quantization to learning rate and weight decay.
When appropriately combined, it becomes possible to create highly sparse and accurate models.

This integration adds a `--recipe` argument to the 
[`train.py` script](https://github.com/neuralmagic/yolact/blob/master/train.py).
The argument loads an appropriate recipe while preserving the rest of the training pipeline.
Popular recipes used with this argument are found in the [`recipes` folder](./recipes).
Otherwise, all other arguments and functionality remain the same as the original repository.
### SparseZoo

SparseZoo models are coming soon!

### Structure

The following table lays out the root-level files and folders along with a description for each.

| Folder/File Name     | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| recipes              | Typical recipes for sparsifying YOLOv5 models along with any downloaded recipes from the SparseZoo.                   |
| yolact               | Integration repository folder used to train and sparsify YOLACT models (setup_integration.sh must run first).         |
| README.md            | Readme file.                                                                                                          |
| setup_integration.sh | Setup file for the integration run from the command line.                                                             |

### Exporting for Inference

After sparsifying a model, the 
[`export.py` script](https://github.com/neuralmagic//blob/master/export.py)
converts the model into deployment formats such as [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/).
The export process is modified such that the quantized and pruned models are 
corrected and folded properly.

For example, the following command can be run from within the Neural Magic's 
yolact repository folder to export a trained/sparsified model's checkpoint:
```bash
python export.py --checkpoint ./quantized-yolact/yolact_darknet53_0_10.pth \
    --recipe ./recipes/yolact.quantized.md \
    --save-dir ./exported-test \
    --name quantized-yolact --batch-size 1 \
    --image-shape 3 550 550 \
    --config yolact_darknet53_config
```

To prevent conversion of a QAT(Quantization Aware Training) Graph to a
Quantized Graph, pass in the `--no-qat` flag:

```bash
python export.py --checkpoint ./quantized-yolact/yolact_darknet53_0_10.pth \
    --recipe ./recipes/yolact.quantized.yaml \
    --save-dir ./exported-test \
    --name qat-yolact --batch-size 1 \
    --image-shape 3 550 550 \
    --config yolact_darknet53_config \
    --no-qat
```

### DeepSparse

The [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) Engine accepts ONNX 
formats and is engineered to significantly speed up inference on CPUs for 
the sparsified models from this integration. [Example](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples/yolact) scripts can be found in the DeepSparse repository.
