    "This notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough for pruning a [torchvision model](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) using SparseML. You will:\n",
    "- Download a pre-trained torchvision model and generic dataset\n",
    "- Define a generic torchvision finetuning flow\n",
    "- Integrate the torchvision flow with SparseML\n",
    "- Prune the model using the torchvision+SparseML flow\n",

    "Reading through this notebook will be reasonably quick to gain an intuition for how to integrate SparseML with torchvision or more generically a PyTorch training flow. Rough time estimates for fully pruning the default model are given. Note that training with the PyTorch CPU implementation will be much slower than a GPU:\n",
